__Simon__: "These properties map to broader / narrower." -- Input to the 
conversion process, to know which properties are hierarchical.  When you are
visualizing in generic visualizer -- view as a tree.  OBO "develops from" and 
"part of" -- for alot of ontologies, just a flat list.  If the broader part 
is transitive.  "For these object properties." -- we can specify.  Gazetteer is 
a good example.  To make sense, have to treat as hierarchical.  Need some way to 
input which ones.  By default, "related".  

__Marie__: OWL class should be SKOS Concept? [Yes].

__Simon__: For OBO library ontologies, they have a standard set of annotation 
properties that we could map to SKOS.  Synonyms and definition.  Then any 
transitive object property would map to SKOS broader.  But we know that part_of 
and develops_from map to SKOS broader - and they are the ones that are mostly.
170 ontologies in the OBO library would be covered.  Everything else maps by 
default to SKOS related.  Then question: superclass descriptions - whether you 
collect all the entitie and have them as related, which I think would be 
reasonable for SKOS representation.  

Good case for SKOS representation, because Bioportal - not possible to navigate 
via properties that are in anonymous class descriptions.
