__Simon__: "These properties map to broader / narrower." -- Input to the 
conversion process, to know which properties are hierarchical.  When you are
visualizing in generic visualizer -- view as a tree.  OBO "develops from" and 
"part of" -- for alot of ontologies, just a flat list.  If the broader part 
is transitive.  "For these object properties." -- we can specify.  Gazetteer is 
a good example.  To make sense, have to treat as hierarchical.  Need some way to 
input which ones.  By default, "related".  

__Marie__: OWL class should be SKOS Concept? [Yes].

__Simon__: For OBO library ontologies, they have a standard set of annotation 
properties that we could map to SKOS.  Synonyms and definition.  Then any 
transitive object property would map to SKOS broader.  But we know that part_of 
and develops_from map to SKOS broader - and they are the ones that are mostly.
170 ontologies in the OBO library would be covered.  Everything else maps by 
default to SKOS related.  Then question: superclass descriptions - whether you 
collect all the entitie and have them as related, which I think would be 
reasonable for SKOS representation.  

Good case for SKOS representation, because Bioportal - not possible to navigate 
via properties that are in anonymous class descriptions.

  Can convert between ontology formats.  The default format is RDF/XML, but 
  there are other RDF formats and the OBO file format.

    robot convert --input annotated.owl --output results/annotated.obo

1. Possibly, ROBOT could convert from OWL to SKOS - but this is just an 
   idea...
2. Convert OWL to OBO (Simon), then OBO to SKOS.
3. Maybe easier, SPARQL to convert from

__Marie__: At the beginning, OBO didn't have reasoning, etc.   Was not convenient 
for community because they wanted to be able to work in Protege, use reasoners, etc.
But applications still needed the OBO format, so kept in parallel.

[Simon fixes the converter by updating to the latest Java, but Marie has
difficulty configuring Java 1.8.0_91, so we postpone use of Simon's converter 
until later and try to test some SPARQL queries.]

Tom writes to Osma:

The Hackathon started yesterday evening, and there is interest in exploring
whether it could be useful to make a browsing interface for OWL ontologies
based on a back-end, lossy translation into SKOS.

Simon Jupp from Manchester is here.  He wrote about SKOS and OWL many years
ago, and uses SKOS this way in his work.  I gather he uses various heuristics
for turning some of the ontology relations into partOf.

The idea would be that, say, Plant Ontology could be translated into SKOS and
loaded into Skosmos or AgroPortal for simple browsing.

Interesting? Crazy?  Has anyone there discussed such a thing?

Osma Suominen responds:

This is something we do quite routinely at NLF. YSO and its many domain
specific extensions are maintained as OWL ontologies (though nowadays most of
the properties are from SKOS) and translated to SKOS using Skosify as part of
the publishing process. Skosify can use a mapping file to convert e.g.
owl:Class into skos:Concept and rdfs:label into skos:prefLabel.

See https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosify/wiki/OWL-conversion-to-SKOS
and the example configuration file
https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosify/blob/master/owl2skos.cfg
which can be used to convert the DCMI Type vocabulary.
