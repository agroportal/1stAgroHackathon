AgroZooma and Google Sheets add-on for Zooma. 
---

This hack involved the development of a Agro tailored instance of Zooma (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma). This was then used to create a google add-on to Zooma and the AgroPortal called ZoomaSheets. This allows you to use Zooma and AgroPortal services to automatically annotate data with ontologies in GoogleSheets.
